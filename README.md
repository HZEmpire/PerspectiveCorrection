This simple python script is used to correct the perspective of building imagesï¼Œ it converts buildings taken from different angles into front view images. 

The script is based on the OpenCV library, which is a powerful tool for image processing.

## Usage

2. Install the required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script
- if default image is put into the ./input folder and the output image will be saved in the ./output folder
```bash
python perspective_correction.py
```
- if you want to specify the input and output image path
```bash
python perspective_correction.py -I <input_image_path> -O <output_image_path>
```
or
```bash
python perspective_correction.py --input <input_image_path> --output <output_image_path>
```
